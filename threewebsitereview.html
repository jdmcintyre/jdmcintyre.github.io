   <h1> Three Website Review: Two Good, One Bad</h1>
   <h2>ESPN: Good - <a href="http://www.espn.com">espn.com</a></h2>
     <p>The first website I will discuss is one of my favorites: ‘espn.com.’ This is the site belonging to the worldwide leader in sports – ESPN. This particular site is one that I visit quite often when checking up on news in the sporting world, along with the scores and updates of some of my favorite teams. When visiting the site, I have noticed some of the great qualities and aspects that make the site so visually appealing.</p>
     <p>ESPN and its website designers/coders did a very good job applying an appropriate amount of whitespace within the content of its pages. The design of this layout highlights the content very well, drawing the audience’s eyes to the words and pictures, for the whitespace used in the padding and margins of the pages is actually gray, while the background color of the body is white. As aforementioned, this allows the viewer’s eyes to focus on the content of the website.</p>
     <p>Other strong aspects of the website include: a strong color-scheme, a very functional navigation bar with various links within the drop-down boxes that include icons of various teams, etc. The colors the site uses are ESPN’s iconic red and black colorways. Once the viewer clicks on said icons within the navigation bar, the site takes you to a link that uses the team-colors of the team selected in an efficient way.</p>
     <p>When taking a closer look at the site’s design, it appears that they use HTML 5 qualities. Aspects such as brackets, ‘div’, hex codes, CSS qualities, etc. Overall, it’s a very strong site.</p>
     
  <h2>NIKE: Good - <a href="http://www.nike.com">nike.com</a></h2>
     <p>The next site I decided to critique was ‘nike.com’ – NIKE’s website. This site has a very sleek-like look to it. There are two different navigation bars – one laying out the various brands that NIKE owns, and another bar differentiating the gender of clothing. These navigation bars are very savvy, when hovered over, the entities of the navigation bar are bolded, display an appealing underline, and a very considerable list of links within the dropdown box.</p>
     <p>To go along with the sleek appeal and design of the site, NIKE and its web designers use black and white colorways throughout the site. An effective use of whitespace is used, for the sites is consumed with large, clear, and engaging pictures that display the company’s products. When the viewer scrolls down the site’s page/various pages, the pictures vary in size and dimension, adding to the site’s modern look. The layout makes sense to me – matching the modern sports and clothing industry we see today.</p>
     <p>NIKE also uses HTML 5 coding throughout their site. When taking a deeper look into the site’s make-up, I noticed differing font families within the cascade style sheet and commented-out features on the HTML code.</p>
    
 <h2>Wyoming High School Activities Association: Bad - <a href="http://www.whsaa.org">whsaa.org</a></h2>
    <p>The last site that I took a look at was the site belonging to the Wyoming High School Activities Association: ‘whsaa.org.’ This site is very outdated. The site uses a variety of colors: different shades of blue, red, gray, white, etc. I do not think that these colors complement each other well. Along with the colors, the site and its creators use unprofessional-looking graphics, as if they were acquired from Microsoft Word’s ‘Clip Art’ feature.</p>
    <p>The navigation bar is located on the left-hand side of the page, running down the page vertically. When hovering the different links, the navigation options do not have bolded or highlighted features. Just like the other two sites, this site has a scrolling feature – this one being much longer than the rest. The reason for this is because the site’s designers did a very bad job designing the padding and margins throughout the site. In fact, the body of the site and its content only takes up one-third of the page, located in the center of the page.</p>
    <p>The sites layout doesn’t make sense to me, for it seems very cluttered and unorganized. The site uses tables, but not nearly as efficient as the other sites.</p>
    <p>The site uses HTML 5 coding, but with HTML and CSS coding that is very limited.</p>
