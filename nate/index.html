        <h1>Welcome to the Nate McGree Fan Page!</h1>
      <h2>#45 On the Field, #1 in Our Hearts</h2>
      <p>Nathaniel (Nate) McGree was born and raised just south of Helena, MT in "Butte, America." As one can imagine, Nate was the talk of the town, excelling in anything that he did, whether it be in the classroom, on the football field, or within the community. After competing on the field, court, and track for the Butte Central Maroons, Nate followed in the family foot steps and took his talents North - to Carroll College and the streets of Helena. The rest is history. </p>
